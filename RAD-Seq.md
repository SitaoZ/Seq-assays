RAD-Seq RAD (Restriction-site Associated DNA) sequencing is a method by which certain restriction enzymes 
are used to fragment genomic DNA samples, followed by size selection and sequencing of molecules within a 
certain size range. This enables reproducible enrichment of a particular set of genomic loci, where the loci
retained for sequencing are more or less randomly distributed over the genome. The sequence data resulting 
from this application may be used for downstream applications including, but not limited to: Linkage analysis, 
inference of population genetics metrics and polymorphism discovery.
